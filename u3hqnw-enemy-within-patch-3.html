Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47811 --- This week at Bungie, TR3-VR was waiting for you. What was once Redacted is now live. Some of our favorite moments in the studio happen when players uncover the secrets in Destiny , whether it’s a new dungeon in the Dreaming City or something much more sinister, hiding within eyeshot of the Traveler.

Read on to catch the full patch notes for today’s update. --- ### Patch Highlights - Ever Upwards: Join the Pioneer Scouts to complete new Quests, Challenges, an Event, and receive your first Backpack. - Backpacks: Equip a Backpack to increase your carry weight, then apply mods to customize its appearance New Features The Sunken Cell stronghold is now available to all players who have completed the main story (critical path). Added the ability to select contracts from the start of expedition screen rather than going to the individual contract boards in Fort Tarsis or in the Launch Bay. Added the ability to launch a new mission from the end of expedition screen without having to return to Fort Tarsis or the Launch Bay. Added the ability to access the Forge during Missions, Strongholds. Prior to TU3 reaching the live game, the AI were more fearful of their lives and took cover constantly. At the moment, it seems that the previous adjustments to the AI have been reversed. Here are a few examples I have noticed during my gameplay. - All enemies, including AI that would normally keep their distance from the player (snipers), are now hyper aggressive and are rushing at the player and do one of two things. The enemy will either melee and run across the room then hide in cover For full post with images, please see our forum post: https://forums.pubg.com/topic/335494-xbox-may-21-pts-patch-notes/ (https://forums.pubg.com/topic/335494-xbox-may-21-pts-patch-notes/) \--- Hello everyone, Today, we are excited to announce that the Public Test Server (PTS) will be making its return on May 21!

The server exists only for testing purposes, and nothing you do there carries over to the live game. It’s also periodically reset, so no character progression is saved once the server is brought down. Due to the PTS being a testing environment, everything that happens there is subject to change before #Invasion: Battle for D.C. =gt Invasion: Battle for D.C.

Patch sizes:. TL;DR: Solo success in torpedo boats is still possible, but demands high base skill. Survival in destroyers has become highly unforgiving. Surface gunfire directed via plane spotting is the primary killer. Mistakes are mercilessly punished. Playing escort is NOT, REPEAT, NOT the key to a high winrate. Find opportunities for high-risk, high-reward attacks. Survive and repeat. Rotate often. Ignore objectives unless capture is safe. Sometimes you’re unlucky. Edit: apologies for the wall of text, but I figure it is necessary to sort things out. However, I adjusted the paragraphs a bit so that it would be more mobile friendly. Also, really appreciate the Reddit gold and silver from the kind users. Just like many other players, I enjoy the marvelous and dynamic game world that the developers have created and really appreciate their open attitude towards the community. However, what concerns me is the possibly vague words that sometimes Welcome to Wild Appalachia!

With the recent drama going on with Whisper of the Worm, Sleeper, super-returning exotics and all of that garbage, I’ve decided that I’m actually going to do something productive. And that productivity comes in the form of my own fan-made patch notes that would make me cream my pants in excitement if I woke up and saw that the changes were real # Season of Opulence Fan Made Patch Notes Season of Opulence is on fast approach and, similar to past Seasons, some sandbox changes will arrive There are some issues that have been in the game since day one. Every patch release, I read through all the notes hoping to see some note about these issues, but so far, nothing. So. Bethseda, please, for the love of God, fix these issues already!
